# Striver's SDE Sheet Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from Striver's SDE Sheet.
Link : `https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/`

I'm using this repository to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in preparation for Software Engineering interviews.

**Getting Started**

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Annany2002/SDE_Sheet.git`
- Choose your programming language (e.g., Java, Python, C++) and create folders for each topic (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.) within the `src` directory.
- Implement the solutions for each problem in the corresponding folder.

**Directory Structure:**

This repository uses the following directory structure to organize solutions:

- **problems:** (**Main Folder**) This folder contains folders for each topic covered in Striver's SDE Sheet.

  - Each topic folder will have its own set of problem files.
  - Problem files will be named after the specific problem (e.g., `two-sum`, `longest-substring-without-repeating-characters`).
    - Inside each problem folder, you can place your solution files (e.g., `two-sum.py`, `longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.java`).
  - You can further create subfolders within topic folders for more granular organization if needed (e.g., `sorting` subfolder within a `Data Structures` topic folder).

  **Example:**
  ├── README.md
  ├── Arrays
  ├── 1_TwoSum.cpp # Example solution file
  │ └── ...
  ├── LinkedLists
  │ ├── 2_ReverseLinkedList.py
  │ └── ...
  └── ... # Other folders for different topics
